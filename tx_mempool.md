# Transaction Mempool
Before putting transactions into a block, nodes first perform sanity checks and filter out invalid transactions. Full-nodes in the network receive transactions from their peers and validate them locally before including them into the [Mempool](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/75ffa2bf1c7d5805460d941a75112e6a0a38c039/mempool/mempool.go), their pool of transactions approved for inclusion in a block. An ABCI procedure, `CheckTX`, is utilized (see below for code) for validation. The transaction is unwrapped into its comprising `Msgs` and `validateBasic`, a stateless validation function implemented by all `Msgs`, is run on each one. The default is for all nodes to broadcast via gossip all of the transactions that pass `CheckTx` and meet the  gas requirements.
